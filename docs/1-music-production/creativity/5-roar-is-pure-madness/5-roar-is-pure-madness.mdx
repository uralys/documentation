## Demo

- `Key idea:` Complex demonstration of ROAR's capabilities using multiple stages, filters, feedback and modulation to create evolving industrial textures.
- `Process / settings:` This opening demo showcases advanced routing configurations with serial and parallel processing, aggressive distortion shapers, resonant filters with LFO modulation, feedback delays synced to tempo.
- `Result:` Demonstrates ROAR's potential for creating complex, evolving, heavily distorted sounds that go far beyond simple saturation.
- `Notes:` Free presets available in video description. This complexity is not always necessary for typical use cases.

## Intro

- `Key idea:` ROAR can feel intimidating with its extensive possibilities, but understanding the device makes it much easier to use effectively.
- `Process / settings:` The video will first provide an overview of the device sections, explain the workflow and interpretation approach, then demonstrate practical techno examples with kicks, percussion, and synths.
- `Result:` A structured learning path from understanding the device to implementing it in productions.
- `Notes:` Most use cases are simpler than the opening demo. The device works best when you understand its core components rather than cranking all parameters.

## Roar Overview

- `Key idea:` ROAR is more of a multi-effect device than just distortion, combining distortion, filters, feedback delay, compression, and modulation.
- `Process / settings:` The device includes multiple sections: input gain with tilt EQ, routing modes for signal flow, wave shapers for distortion character, filters for tone shaping, feedback section for delay/metallic effects, output with compression, and modulation tab with LFO, envelope follower, and noise sources.
- `Result:` A comprehensive understanding that ROAR combines saturation, filtering, feedback/delay, compression and modulation in one device.
- `Notes:` Thinking of ROAR as a multi-effect helps navigate its features more effectively.

*02:40 → 02:56*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={roarOverview} timeSec={160} />

## Input

- `Key idea:` The input section is often overlooked but crucial because distortion reacts very differently to different frequency content and levels.
- `Process / settings:` `Drive` controls input gain. `Tone` is a tilt EQ where increasing boosts highs and lowers lows, decreasing does the opposite. `Shelf` defines the low shelf frequency around `185 Hz`. `Color` applies the mirror version of the tilt EQ at the output for compensation.
- `Result:` Proper input staging and tone shaping dramatically affects the character of the distortion that follows.
- `Notes:` Experiment with tone and drive before adjusting distortion amount. Small changes here have significant impact on the final sound.

*02:56 → 03:48*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={input} timeSec={176} />

## Routing

- `Key idea:` ROAR offers five routing modes that determine signal flow and processing architecture, each suited for different creative purposes.
- `Process / settings:` `Single` mode uses one stage (most common use). `Serial` mode chains two stages with blend control (stage 1 feeds stage 2, great for kicks). `Parallel` mode processes both stages independently (useful for morphing effects with LFO on blend). `Multiband` mode splits signal into low/mid/high bands with crossover at `400 Hz` and `2 kHz` (great for exciter use or multiband filtering). `Mid/Side` mode processes center and sides separately (enhances existing stereo, doesn't create it). `Feedback` mode processes direct and feedback signals independently (creates metallic, flanging effects).
- `Result:` Different routing modes unlock completely different sonic possibilities from simple saturation to complex multiband processing and feedback effects.
- `Notes:` Start with `Single` mode, then explore `Serial` for added intensity, `Multiband` for surgical processing. In `Serial` mode, even when stage 1 is muted, it still affects stage 2's sound.

*03:48 → 06:58*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={routing} timeSec={228} />

## Shaper

- `Key idea:` ROAR provides 12 different wave shapers organized into categories based on their character: classic/clean, dirty/noisy, double-edged, and special.
- `Process / settings:` Classic clean shapers (`Soft`, `Sign`, `Digital Clip`, `Diode`, `Tube`) are linear and warm, clean until `30%` amount, then gradually add grit. Dirty shapers (`Noise`, `Shard`, `Bit Crusher`) add lo-fi, dusty artifacts, great for mid/high exciter use or serial/parallel processing. Double-edged shapers (`Polynomial`, `Fractal`, `Trifold`) are clean at low amounts (`10-30%`) but become extremely metallic and harsh beyond that, work best with simple waveforms like sine or triangle. Special shapers (`Halfwave Rectifier`, `Fullwave Rectifier`) are very unique, generate lots of harmonics, also work best with simple harmonic sources. `Amount` parameter controls intensity (don't overlook sweet spots under `30%`). `Bias` produces asymmetrical clipping (use subtle values).
- `Result:` Understanding shaper categories helps quickly select the right character for your sound without testing all 12 every time.
- `Notes:` Start with amounts under `30%` to find sweet spots. Polynomial, Fractal, and Trifold feed well with sine/triangle waves but can create unwanted harmonics with complex sources. Shard and Noise work great in multiband mode on mid/high for excitement.

*06:58 → 11:09*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={shaper} timeSec={418} />

## Filter

- `Key idea:` The filter section is its own effect unit offering classic filtering plus creative options like morph, comb and resampling.
- `Process / settings:` Filter types include `Low Pass`, `Band Pass`, `High Pass` for traditional frequency shaping (useful to tame distortion highs), `Peak` for notch EQ or sweeping modulation effects, `Morph` filter for complex movement (see dedicated tutorial video), `Comb` filter creates flanging effects great for hypnotic techno. `Resampling` acts similar to a redux/bit reduction effect. `Pre` button places filter before the shaper, which can make certain frequencies "scream" or react dramatically with the distortion.
- `Result:` Filters can be used traditionally for tone control or creatively for rhythmic movement and texture.
- `Notes:` Combining filter, feedback and pre-shaper placement creates wild experimental results. Morph filter has its own dedicated tutorial (linked in description).

*11:09 → 12:13*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={filter} timeSec={669} />

## Feedback

- `Key idea:` The feedback section doubles as a classic delay or experimental metallic effect depending on time settings.
- `Process / settings:` `Time` and `Amount` control delay behavior. Sync to BPM for rhythmic delays. Switch to `Time Mode` with short values (`<10 ms`) for metallic/flanging effects. `Note Mode` pitches the delay time to musical notes. `Invert Phase` provides different tonal colors. `Gate` fades feedback when no input signal is present (disable for infinite feedback tones).
- `Result:` Feedback section creates classic delay effects or unique metallic/flanging textures depending on time range.
- `Notes:` Delays sync to BPM for rhythmic use. Short delay times (`<10 ms`) in Time Mode create metallic effects. Gate keeps feedback from running infinitely.

*12:13 → 13:19*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={feedback} timeSec={733} />

## Output

- `Key idea:` Output section provides compression and parallel processing controls to manage the often wild dynamics from ROAR.
- `Process / settings:` Built-in compressor with `Threshold`, `Ratio`, `Attack`, `Release` helps tame extreme distortion peaks. `Sidechain HPF` removes low frequencies from compressor detection for more global compression behavior (less low-end pumping). `Output` gain for level matching. `Dry/Wet` blend enables parallel processing.
- `Result:` Compression tames ROAR's aggressive dynamics while dry/wet blend allows subtle parallel saturation techniques.
- `Notes:` Compression is very useful since feedback and aggressive shapers can create wild dynamic spikes. Sidechain HPF prevents low-end from dominating compression triggering.

*13:19 → 13:40*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={output} timeSec={799} />

## Modulation

- `Key idea:` Modulation section brings ROAR to life with LFO, envelope follower, and noise sources, though it's not mandatory for every use case.
- `Process / settings:` `LFO` offers 5 basic waveforms with morphing, rate control, free or synced modes (great for morphing between parallel stages or rhythmic filter sweeps). `Envelope Follower` with attack/release acts like a synthesizer envelope, perfect for filter cutoff modulation or shaper amount dynamics (emphasizes transients). `Noise` sources include smooth `Simplex`/`Wander`, stepped `Sample and Hold`, and `Brown` for adding subtle drift/grit.
- `Result:` Modulation transforms static processing into dynamic, evolving textures and rhythmic movement.
- `Notes:` Not every use case requires modulation. Most useful when combining feedback, filter and distortion for movement. Envelope follower is excellent for transient emphasis and synthesizer-style envelope behavior.

*13:40 → 15:03*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={modulation} timeSec={820} />

## Raw Techno Kick

- `Key idea:` Multiband mode enhances kick drum mid and high frequencies for additional punch and presence without affecting the low end.
- `Process / settings:` `Multiband` routing with low band using minimal processing, mid band using `Tube` shaper, high band using `Digital` shaper. Multiple instances of ROAR stacked in serial or parallel. Use `Peak` filter as EQ to sculpt mid presence. Small amounts of distortion on mid/high bands add excitement and transient sharpness.
- `Result:` Kick drum gains mid-high punch and presence while maintaining clean low end.
- `Notes:` Multiband mode is the preferred approach for kick processing. Stacking multiple ROAR instances allows cumulative enhancements. Think of this as mixing technique meets sound design.

*15:03 → 16:21*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={rawTechnoKick} timeSec={903} />

## Industrial Techno Kick

- `Key idea:` Aggressive multiband processing with noisy shapers creates industrial kick character with harsh mid-high aggression.
- `Process / settings:` `Multiband` mode. Low band uses `Polynomial` shaper. Mid band uses `Trifold` shaper. High band uses `Noise` shaper. `Peak` filter for low-end EQ. Second ROAR instance also in multiband: low with `Soft`, mid with `Trifold`, high with `Fractal`. Shaper selection is experimental, cycle through options to find best match for source.
- `Result:` Industrial-grade kick with harsh, noisy mid-high content and aggressive transients.
- `Notes:` No fixed rules for shaper selection, experiment with source material. What works for one kick may not work for another. Multiple ROAR instances compound the effect.

*16:21 → 17:16*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={industrialTechnoKick} timeSec={981} />

## Hats Enhancer

- `Key idea:` Multiband mode acts as an exciter for hi-hats, making them louder and more present in the mix.
- `Process / settings:` `Multiband` routing. Low band uses `Fractal`, mid band uses `Tube`, high band uses `Polynomial` at `75%` amount. Small amounts of distortion add harmonic excitement to mid and high frequencies.
- `Result:` Hi-hats become louder, brighter and more upfront without harsh EQ boosts.
- `Notes:` This is the typical exciter application. Noisy/lo-fi shapers work well for adding presence to drums and percussion.

*17:16 → 17:36*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={hatsEnhancer} timeSec={1036} />

## Clap Sharpener

- `Key idea:` Multiband processing sharpens clap transients and enhances mid-high presence for more aggressive character.
- `Process / settings:` `Multiband` mode. Low uses `Fractal`, mid uses `Tube`, high uses `Polynomial` at `75%`. Focus distortion on mid and high bands to emphasize the transient attack.
- `Result:` Clap becomes sharper with enhanced transient definition and increased presence.
- `Notes:` Similar to hats processing. Multiband distortion on mid-high adds sharpness and transient emphasis.

*17:36 → 17:51*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={clapSharpener} timeSec={1056} />

## Acid Disto

- `Key idea:` Using pre-filter placement with peak filter and envelope modulation creates sweeping acid-style distortion effects.
- `Process / settings:` `Serial` mode. Stage 1 uses `Diode` shaper with `Peak` filter in `Pre` mode (before shaper). Stage 2 uses `Soft` shaper. `Envelope Follower` modulates filter 1 frequency for sweeping movement. Pre-filter placement makes distortion react dramatically to frequency emphasis.
- `Result:` Acid sound with dynamic sweeping distortion that follows note envelopes.
- `Notes:` Pre-filter placement is key for making the shaper "scream" or react aggressively. Envelope modulation creates synthesizer-style filter envelope behavior.

*17:51 → 18:20*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={acidDisto} timeSec={1071} />

## Acid Growl

- `Key idea:` Combining resampling filter with aggressive shapers creates lo-fi, gritty acid textures with digital artifacts.
- `Process / settings:` `Single` or `Serial` mode. Use `Resampling` filter with modulated frequency. `Shard` shaper for lo-fi character. Adjust resampling frequency for different digital artifacts and tones.
- `Result:` Acid bass with lo-fi, crunchy, digital character and variable tone textures.
- `Notes:` Resampling filter creates similar effect to redux/bit reduction. Works well with bit crusher and shard shapers for cohesive lo-fi aesthetic.

*18:20 → 18:34*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={acidGrowl} timeSec={1100} />

## Fat Synth

- `Key idea:` Multiband processing adds harmonic richness and loudness to synths by driving mid and high frequencies.
- `Process / settings:` `Multiband` mode with crossover adjusted around `500 Hz` to `1 kHz`. Mid uses `Tube` shaper for harmonic saturation. High uses `Tube` shaper with increased amount to add transients. `Peak` filter for EQ shaping.
- `Result:` Synth becomes louder, brighter, and more harmonically rich with emphasized transients.
- `Notes:` Multiband approach allows adding mid harmonic content for loudness while high band adds transient emphasis and brightness. Works as both mixing and sound design tool.

*18:34 → 19:12*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={fatSynth} timeSec={1114} />

## Hypnotic Synth

- `Key idea:` Using polynomial shaper on simple waveforms with resampling filter and modulation creates evolving hypnotic textures.
- `Process / settings:` Start with simple waveform (sine or triangle). `Single` mode. `Polynomial` shaper at `80%` amount to twist and fold the waveform. `Resampling` filter modulated by slow `LFO` for digital texture variation. `Envelope Follower` modulates shaper amount to emphasize transients rather than constant distortion.
- `Result:` Hypnotic, evolving synth sound with complex harmonics and digital texture movement.
- `Notes:` Polynomial/Fractal/Trifold work best with simple waveforms. Envelope on amount captures transient for sharper effect. Slow LFO on resampling adds gradual texture evolution.

*19:12 → 20:10*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={hypnoticSynth} timeSec={1152} />

## Hypnotic Bass

- `Key idea:` Parallel processing with feedback, modulated filters and automation creates complex evolving bass textures.
- `Process / settings:` `Parallel` mode. Stage 1 uses `Polynomial` with high amount, modulated by envelope. Stage 2 uses `Tube`. `Peak` filter modulated by envelope for sweep effect. Feedback section with automation on feedback amount. Noise modulation on feedback frequency, feedback amount, and shaper 1 amount for randomization. Adjust dry/wet to taste.
- `Result:` Complex, evolving hypnotic bassline with feedback delays, filter sweeps and randomized movement.
- `Notes:` Heavy use of modulation with automation for variation. Parallel mode allows blending different distortion characters. Multiple modulation sources create non-repetitive evolution.

*20:10 → 21:22*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={hypnoticBass} timeSec={1210} />

## Dub Chord 1

- `Key idea:` Feedback mode with noisy shapers and modulated filters adds grit and movement to plain dub chords through delay processing.
- `Process / settings:` `Feedback` mode to process feedback signal differently from input. Direct uses `Noise` shaper, feedback uses `Shard` shaper for maximum grit. `Peak` filter with `LFO` modulation creates sweeping effect. Both direct and feedback filters modulated by different `LFO` speeds for complex sweeping movement. Feedback section set to synced delay with filter. Noise modulation on feedback `Amount` and `Frequency` for randomization (makes feedback appear intermittently rather than constantly).
- `Result:` Plain chord transformed with gritty texture, complex filter sweeps, and intermittent rhythmic delay.
- `Notes:` Feedback mode allows independent processing of feedback signal. Multiple LFOs at different speeds create complex, non-looping filter movements. Noise modulation makes feedback unpredictable and musical.

*21:22 → 23:27*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={dubChord1} timeSec={1282} />

## Dub Chord 2

- `Key idea:` Serial mode with high-pass and low-pass filters creates band-pass effect while modulation adds slow evolving character.
- `Process / settings:` `Serial` mode. Stage 1 uses `High Pass` filter. Stage 2 uses `Low Pass` filter (combining creates band-pass effect). Noisy shapers for dub texture. Feedback with synced delay. `LFO` modulation on both filter frequencies for slow sweeping movement. Noise modulation on shaper amounts for variation.
- `Result:` Filtered dub chord with band-pass character, slow evolving sweeps, and feedback delay.
- `Notes:` Creating band-pass by chaining HPF and LPF in serial stages. Great for dub techno filtering. Slow modulation creates gradual evolution rather than obvious rhythmic movement.

*23:27 → 24:30*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={dubChord2} timeSec={1407} />

## Drum Bus

- `Key idea:` Multiband processing on drum bus adds excitement and presence while soft clipping tightens low end.
- `Process / settings:` `Multiband` mode. Low uses `Soft` clipping for tight, controlled low end. Mid uses `Shard` shaper for noisy, lo-fi excitement (typical exciter use). High band processing for top-end enhancement. Crossover at `99 Hz` and (non précisé).
- `Result:` Drum mix becomes tighter in low end with enhanced mid-high presence and excitement.
- `Notes:` Multiband on drum bus is mixing application. Shard/Noise shapers excel at mid-high exciter duties. Useful when mix lacks air or top end presence.

*24:30 → 25:15*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={drumBus} timeSec={1470} />

## Industrial Perc 1

- `Key idea:` Aggressive peak filter with envelope modulation and serial processing creates resonant, evolving percussion tones.
- `Process / settings:` `Serial` mode. Stage 1 uses `Peak` filter with very high resonance and gain, modulated by `Envelope Follower` on frequency (creates screaming, resonant sweep). `Soft Clipping` shaper. Stage 2 uses `Fractal` for additional stereo width and harmonics. `Comb` filter for additional movement. Envelope modulates filter frequency and shaper amounts.
- `Result:` Percussion with screaming, resonant character and dramatic tonal evolution per hit.
- `Notes:` High resonance peak filter before shaper creates extreme resonant behavior. Envelope follower acts like synthesizer ADSR for filter and shaper modulation.

*25:15 → 25:43*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={industrialPerc1} timeSec={1515} />

## Industrial Perc 2

- `Key idea:` Feedback in note mode with envelope modulation creates pitched metallic delay tails on percussion.
- `Process / settings:` `Serial` mode. `Soft Clipping` shaper. `Comb` filter modulated by envelope. Feedback section in `Note Mode` to pitch delay time musically. `Envelope Follower` modulates output level (opens only when signal is present to prevent infinite feedback tail). Multiple envelope modulations on filter frequency, shaper amount, and output.
- `Result:` Percussion with complex, pitched metallic feedback that follows the transient envelope.
- `Notes:` Envelope on output level acts as gate to control feedback duration. Note mode feedback creates musical pitch instead of raw delay time. Comb filter adds flanging texture.

*25:43 → 27:03*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={industrialPerc2} timeSec={1543} />

## Metallic Perc

- `Key idea:` Serial mode with tube and noise shapers plus envelope modulation creates bright, noisy metallic percussion.
- `Process / settings:` `Serial` mode. Stage 1 uses `Tube` shaper. Stage 2 uses `Noise` shaper. Feedback for metallic character. `Envelope Follower` modulates output, shaper 1 amount, shaper 1 bias, shaper 2 amount, feedback amount, and feedback frequency. Feedback in time mode or note mode for pitch envelope effect.
- `Result:` Metallic percussion with noisy character and pitch/feedback evolution.
- `Notes:` Heavy envelope modulation creates synthesizer-like behavior. Feedback frequency modulation by envelope creates pitch envelope effect on metallic tail.

*27:03 → 27:35*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={metallicPerc} timeSec={1623} />

## Stab

- `Key idea:` Feedback creates metallic tail on stabs with envelope-controlled filter for classic synth envelope behavior.
- `Process / settings:` Feedback mode with metallic settings. `Envelope Follower` modulates filter frequency (like synthesizer filter cutoff envelope) and shaper amount.
- `Result:` Stab sound with metallic feedback tail and envelope-shaped filter sweep.
- `Notes:` Envelope follower provides classic synthesizer ADSR-style modulation. This preset works specifically well on stabs but less so on percussion.

*27:35 → 28:01*
<VideoPlayer videoId="Ve4F0dd5AFU" overlay={stab} timeSec={1655} />

## F1 sound

- `Key idea:` Extreme feedback and filter settings create Formula 1 race car-like sounds from basic sources.
- `Process / settings:` (non précisé)
- `Result:` Emulation of F1 race car engine sounds.
- `Notes:` Creative experimental use of ROAR beyond typical musical applications.
