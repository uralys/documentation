# The Delay Trick for Focused Mixes

<i>In this video we're looking at a simple, but very effective technique to keep your delays or reverbs from cluttering your mix.</i>

## Introduction

- `Key idea:` A mixing trick to open up space in the mix and help instruments breathe and groove by preventing delays from muddying the dry signal.
- `Process / settings:` Demonstrated using a saxophone line from the album Chroma Dream with SoundToys Echo Boy delay plugin.
- `Result:` The delay fills in tiny gaps between notes without overshadowing the performance.
- `Notes:` This technique was used heavily in the album Chroma Dream.

## The Trick

- `Key idea:` Use sidechain compression to duck the delay signal when the dry instrument is playing, allowing the delay to fill only the gaps between notes.
- `Process / settings:`
  - Group the delay effect into an audio effect track to use it in parallel
  - Set the delay to `100% wet` (like a return track)
  - Create a new chain for the dry unaffected signal
  - Add a compressor to the delay chain, enable sidechain
  - Select the source track as input and choose the dry chain (prefix/post-effects/post-mixer options available)
  - Adjust `threshold` to control how much delay is heard while the instrument plays
  - Adjust `release` to determine how quickly the delay comes back between notes
- `Result:` The dry signal causes the delay to duck out whenever a note is playing, preventing the delay from muddying the dry recording.
- `Notes:` Setting the release fairly fast avoids creating a noticeable pumping effect on the echo. Prefix sends raw unprocessed audio, post-effects includes effects, post-mixer includes volume/panning/returns.

## Processing the Delay

- `Key idea:` Apply additional processing to the wet delay signal independently from the dry signal.
- `Process / settings:`
  - Use an EQ to shape the tone of the delay
  - Add subtle vibrato to the delay for a broken tape delay vibe
  - Use a tuner to ensure the vibrato doesn't drift too far out of tune
- `Result:` The delay no longer clouds the melody and the vibrato adds a subtle vintage character to the sound.
- `Notes:` Audio effect tracks allow processing effects specifically on the wet signal.

## Other Delays

- `Key idea:` Some delay plugins include built-in ducking features that achieve the same result without manual sidechain setup.
- `Process / settings:`
  - FabFilter Timeless includes advanced ducking features
  - Ableton Live's stock Echo effect also has ducking built-in
  - Set parameters to similar values as the manual sidechain setup
  - Gradually lower the threshold to find the right level while the track plays
- `Result:` Achieves the same ducking effect with less manual routing.
- `Notes:` Using built-in ducking can be faster and more convenient than manual sidechain compression.

## More Applications

- `Key idea:` This sidechain technique works well on other sources beyond instrumental melodies.
- `Process / settings:`
  - Sidechain delay on rap vocals to keep clarity
  - Sidechain reverb on synth bass to maintain punch and clarity
- `Result:` Delays and reverbs stay out of the way of the main signal, maintaining focus in the mix.
- `Notes:` The technique can be applied to any source where space effects might cloud the main sound. Effects shown were slightly exaggerated for demonstration purposes.
