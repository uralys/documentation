# Few Ableton Stock Devices

<i>
"After years of getting more and more plugins I finally figured out those two things:
1. Truly unique plugins are RARE. New plugins are to solve yet another "major problem", but the truth is that there's already a tool that takes care of that.
2. ...thats why if you just want to get things done and have fun with producing - USE STOCK PLUGINS. Sure, they won't replace that "analog character" but just like with third party plugins - stock Ableton devices are getting better and better"

## Intro

- `Key idea:` Ableton stock devices can replace most third-party plugins for mixing and sound design tasks.
- `Process / settings:` Use built-in devices like Envelope Follower, Saturator, Glue Compressor, Hybrid Reverb, and Roar instead of expensive plugins.
- `Result:` Professional mixing results without additional plugin investments.
- `Notes:` Requires Ableton Live 12 for Roar device.

## Cutting Frequencies - Sidechain with Envelope Follower

- `Key idea:` Create dynamic frequency ducking on bass using Envelope Follower instead of purchasing sidechain plugins like Trackspacer or Fuser.
- `Process / settings:`
  - Place Envelope Follower on kick track
  - Identify clashing frequencies using spectrum analyzer (in example: `74 Hz` kick peak)
  - Add EQ8 band at the clashing frequency on bass channel
  - Map Envelope Follower to EQ gain via modulation (M button)
  - Set modulation range from `50%` (flat) to `0` (full cut)
  - Adjust Q factor and bandwidth to taste
- `Result:` Bass automatically ducks at kick frequencies when kick hits, maintaining low-end clarity without permanent frequency cuts.
- `Notes:` Superior to regular sidechain compression which can lose low-end. Alternative: use standard sidechain compression if dynamic EQ is too complex.

## Sub Boom - Bass Enhancement

- `Key idea:` Use Ableton's built-in Sub Boom device instead of third-party sub enhancers like RBass.
- `Process / settings:`
  - Add Sub Boom device to bass channel
  - Adjust dry/wet knob to control effect amount
  - Tune to song key (example: `G#`)
  - Control tone brightness parameter
  - Adjust pitch/size parameter for sub frequency range
  - Modify decay time of the sub tail
- `Result:` Enhanced sub-bass presence with tonal control and proper key tuning.
- `Notes:` Sub Boom offers brightness, pitch, and decay controls for precise sub shaping.

## Compressor - Parallel Compression Technique

- `Key idea:` Ableton's Glue Compressor excels at parallel compression with proper attack control for drum processing.
- `Process / settings:`
  - Use basic compressor for standard compression tasks
  - Use Glue Compressor specifically for parallel drum compression
  - Control transient response via attack knob
  - Slower attack preserves more transients
  - Faster attack removes transients
  - Avoid blindly slamming threshold to maximum
- `Result:` Controlled, punchy drums with preserved or shaped transients depending on attack setting.
- `Notes:` Attack time is the key parameter for controlling drum character in parallel compression. Don't just slam threshold and hope for good results.

## Roar - Multiband Waveshaping

- `Key idea:` Roar is Ableton Live 12's built-in multiband waveshaper, replacing expensive saturation plugins like Saturn.
- `Process / settings:`
  - Access via stock Ableton preset called "Ott" (don't use third-party Ott plugin)
  - Choose from multiple waveshaper algorithms (example: Fractal, Style Clipper, Soft Sign)
  - Enable multiband mode with three bands: low, mid, high
  - Apply different shapers to each band independently
  - Two crossover points for band separation
  - Access modulation via mod sources: `2 LFOs`, `envelope follower`, `noise modulator`
  - Modulate parameters via modulation matrix
- `Result:` Complex harmonic shaping with independent frequency band processing and dynamic modulation capabilities.
- `Notes:` Exclusive to Live 12. Crossover flexibility is limited to two points. Full modulation matrix available for creative sound design. Alternative to spending `$130` on saturation plugins.

## Clipper - Saturator as Soft Clipper

- `Key idea:` Use Saturator with soft clip engaged as a clipper for transient shaping and loudness.
- `Process / settings:`
  - Add Saturator device
  - Enable soft clip button
  - Drive the input signal
  - Use gain matching via Utility before or makeup gain after
  - Monitor output meter for clipping indication (example: kick peaking at `-6 dB`)
  - Watch waveform shape change during clipping
- `Result:` Controlled soft clipping that shapes transients and increases perceived loudness without harsh distortion.
- `Notes:` Saturator can lean more toward saturation character. For pure clipping, Glue Compressor method may be preferable.

## Glue Compressor - Alternative Soft Clipper

- `Key idea:` Glue Compressor can function as a transparent soft clipper when compression is disabled.
- `Process / settings:`
  - Add Glue Compressor
  - Turn range knob down (disables compression)
  - Enable soft clip button
  - Drive signal using Utility before compressor OR use makeup gain on compressor
  - Use Utility after for gain matching
  - Monitor clipping indicator
- `Result:` Transparent soft clipping with minimal coloration, focusing on transient control and loudness.
- `Notes:` Cleaner clipping alternative to Saturator method. Watch transient shape changes during clipping.

## Hybrid Reverb - Creative Reverb Design

- `Key idea:` Hybrid Reverb combines convolution and algorithmic reverb, allowing custom impulse responses from any audio file.
- `Process / settings:`
  - Load any audio file (example: snare sample) as impulse response in convolution section
  - Adjust blend knob to control convolution vs. algorithmic balance
  - Use size parameter to change pitch of reverb tail
  - Mix in algorithmic reverb section for additional character
  - Create automation curves for reverb parameters (example: reverb throws)
  - Copy and adjust automation points for varied effects
- `Result:` Unique reverb textures impossible with standard reverbs, with dynamic automation for creative effects.
- `Notes:` More unique sounds than commonly-used Valhalla reverbs. Can use any WAV file as impulse response. Supports complex automation curves beyond basic reverb throws.
