Hello. These days, everyone's digging through pretty much the same sample websites, which means a lot of producers
0:06
end up using the exact same sounds and loops. So, if you're just dropping these loops straight into your tracks, there's
0:12
an almost 100% chance someone else already used that exact same loop. And you might even run into copyright
0:18
issues. Just trash is zamming any melodic loop from Splice and you'll see for yourself. It's actually getting
0:24
pretty ridiculous. That's why it's so important to get creative with these loops, especially the melodic ones. In
0:30
this two-part video, I'm going to show you 10 creative ways to transform loops so they sound fresh, unique, and truly
0:37
like you. Before we dive in, just a quick note that you can find all of the track stems for every technique I cover
0:44
in this video, plus full track breakdowns where I go into all the fine details of my songs over on Patreon.
0:51
With that being said, don't forget to hit subscribe and let's jump right in. Now, let's say you found the drum loop
Borrowing grooves
0:57
and you like the pattern and the groove, but you're not really a big fan of the sounds and they don't fit your track.
1:02
Well, let me show you how you can extract the rhythm and apply it to your own drum sounds in just a few steps.
1:08
Here's a loop from my Donut Drums 2 sample pack. [Music]
1:21
The first thing we'll do is rightclick our audio clip and select convert drums to new MIDI track.
1:29
Live has now converted the groove into a MIDI pattern and assigned it to its default 606 drum machine sounds.
1:42
When I bring in the original loop, you can hear that they line up perfectly.
1:52
Now, one important thing to note here is that Live creates a MIDI note for every hit that's marked with a light gray
1:58
transient marker. But if Live misses a hit, you can manually add a marker to make sure it's detected. Live will then
2:04
automatically analyze a sound and place a MIDI note for it in the correct drum slot.
2:11
If we look at the detected velocities, you'll notice that they're pretty much all over the place, which isn't ideal,
2:17
but a quick way to fix this is by using Ableton's velocity MIDI effect. The
2:22
outype parameter sets the maximum velocity for the MIDI note. So, if we set it to 100, for example, any notes
2:28
with a higher velocity will be reduced back to 100.
2:34
The outlow parameter does the opposite and will boost the velocity of any note that falls below this value. This means
2:41
that if we set both parameters to 100, every single note will hit at a value of
2:46
100.
2:52
From my experience, setting the out low value to around 70 or 80 gives the most natural results for these kind of beats.
3:05
All right. Now, to lock in these velocity changes, we'll simply duplicate the track, clear the existing clip, and
3:11
set the new track to receive MIDI from the original drum MIDI channel. If we then hit record, Live will re-record the
3:18
MIDI clip, but with the adjusted velocities.
3:24
And if we take a quick look at this new clip here, you can see that all the velocities now fall in the range that we
3:30
set using the velocity tool. First, let's delete all the sounds from this drum rack that we're not using in our
3:36
MIDI clip. While we could swap out the sounds directly in this drum rack, I prefer
3:42
having each drum sound on a separate track for better clarity and flexibility. We can do this easily by
3:48
right-clicking each drum rack layer and selecting extract chain, which moves the sound and its MIDI notes to a new MIDI
3:54
track. Cool. Now, let's rename these tracks like model students and start swapping out the sounds. We'll start off
4:01
with the kick drum.
4:06
This kick sounds pretty nice, actually. It could work well as some kind of subkick to layer in with the original
4:12
break for extra weight. But for this track, I'm going to go with a more hip-hop inspired sound. So, let's dive
4:18
into my Donut Drums 3 sample pack and grab one of these more acoustic sounding kicks.
4:25
I'll grab both of these refined kicks. One is the main kick and the other one is more kind of a pre-kick, which will
4:31
add subtle ghost notes to enhance a groove. We'll set the velocity to 100% and then hit copy value to siblings. So
4:38
this adjustment applies to all the other sounds in the rack as well. Let's drag the kicks that fall on the beat to the
4:45
main kick and the in between notes to the shorter, more subdued ghost kick.
4:50
This will add a way more natural and human feel compared to having the same kick every time. Let's run the pattern
4:57
and balance out the volumes of both kicks. Now, [Music]
5:03
the ghost kick is a bit too quiet here. So, let's bring up the volume just enough to keep it slightly softer than
5:09
the main kick.
5:15
All right, that sounds great. So, let's move over to the snare.
5:23
I want the snares to hit at full force every time here. So, I'll select all the notes, drag their velocities all the way
5:29
up to even them out, and then bring them back down to 100. Let's see what snares we've got in this
5:36
doughnut drums three pack. [Music]
5:41
This interlace one sounds nice and crispy. So, let's swap it out with the 606 in our drum rack and set the
5:47
velocity to a 100%.
5:55
Let's listen to the kick and the snare combined.
6:02
We're definitely starting to feel that dilla style swing here, but a huge part of the vibe comes from the high hats.
6:08
So, let's dive into those and see how we can tweak them.
6:16
A whole lot of swing in this loop. So, let's see if we can find some sounds.
6:21
Let's drag both of these triplet ones into our drum rack. Let's set the velocity of both high hats to 100 again
6:28
using the copy value to siblings feature. Then, just like with the kicks, I'll drag the hats that fall on each
6:34
beat to the main hat and the in between ones to the smaller hat. Feel free to experiment with a pattern here because
6:41
an interesting high head groove can make a really big difference in the overall feel and groove of the drums.
6:55
Now, let's balance out these high hats.
7:02
And I think I'll also make the smaller head even shorter and try to get rid of some of the noise that's embedded into
7:09
the high head sample. Sweet. Now, let's group these bad boys
7:16
and listen to the drum group. [Music]
7:27
Let's compare. [Music]
7:39
The drum group's clipping now. So, let's bring down the volume of the drum layers.
7:44
[Music] Just for fun, let's glue the drum bus
7:51
together with a glue compressor. I'm going to activate the highp pass filter here on the side chain to keep the kick
7:57
from triggering it too much. And then I'll set a slow attack and fast release for just a few dB of transparent
8:03
compression. [Music]
8:11
And let's add some extra character with the saturator. [Music]
8:21
I'm just dialing in enough to give the drum some warmth and punch without over cooking them. And then let's top it off
8:27
with a limiter to bring up the volume.
8:38
Let's compare both again. [Music]
8:43
Let's see what happens when we layer them.
8:50
One of my favorite tricks with this approach, especially when using the groove from a live drum break, is to
8:56
highpass the break and then use a transient designer like transient master to soften the transients with a slow
9:02
attack.
9:17
If we then blend it back in, we can reintroduce some of that nice character full live sound without interfering with
9:23
our own kick and snare.
9:46
If you're working with live drum breaks or drum recordings, this is a great way to layer them with electronic sounds for
9:52
extra width or a different texture. And that is how you can take a drum groove and make it your own. On to the next
9:59
one. For the second technique, we're going to explore a rather unconventional way to chop up a sample. Let's check out
Generative chopping
10:06
this 5B melodic loop that I found on Splice. So, in a hilariously ironic twist of
10:12
events, this video actually got a copyright claim on this exact section where I was playing a melodic loop from
10:18
Splice. But if I throw some drums underneath it, we should be good to go. Now, with a tempo of 90 BPM and a warm,
10:26
tapy, vintage kind of sound, this loop is likely meant for a boombab hip-hop beat. But to me, it instantly gave off
10:33
this late ' 90s, early 2000s deft punk just this French house kind of vibe. So,
10:38
I put together a disco inspired loop to chop the sample, too.
10:51
All right. Now, I bet that if we just add some side chaining to this melodic loop, it will already sound pretty
10:56
tight. Let's see.
11:06
Yeah, this already sounds pretty banging to be honest. [Music]
11:13
Let's be a little more creative and turn it into something we can call our own. The first thing we'll do is set up a
11:19
simpler and copy over the side chain compressor. Now, let's drag our loop into simpler and switch it to slice
11:26
mode. Here, you can choose to what division the loop will be sliced. I'll go for half a beat for now. Let's create
11:33
an empty MIDI clip here and use Live 12's new MIDI generative tools to quickly generate a pattern for us. Let's
11:40
head over to the MIDI generative tools tab here. First, we'll need to set the note range that Live will use to
11:46
generate a random pattern. Usually, C1 will be the very first chop,
11:53
which is also the case here. Now, let's check the highest notes,
12:00
[Music] which appears to be D sharp 2. Now, let's enter this under the little pitch
12:06
section here. As you can see, life has already generated a pattern here within this range. But let's shorten the clip
12:12
to a two bar loop because French House often relies on very short repetitive patterns and we want to honor the French
12:19
grades here. So, let's do the same. Cool. Now, let's listen to this pattern for a second.
12:29
Listening with the drums will give us a better idea.
12:38
By selecting all the notes and hitting generate, we can keep on creating new patterns until we find something that
12:44
feels right. [Music]
13:03
Live automatically quantizes the pattern to the grid. So, let's see how it changes when we set the grid to eighth
13:09
notes.
13:16
Let's switch it up again.
13:33
right now. The trigger mode is set to trigger, meaning each chop plays in its entirety, no matter the MIDI node
13:39
length. If we set it to gate, however, the chop will only play for as long as a note lasts, which creates a very cool
13:45
tight and chopped up feel that works great for the French house sound.
13:57
Sounds pretty cool. So, let's duplicate the loop now to make it four bars in length and tweak a few notes to add
14:03
variation and keep it evolving. [Music]
14:22
All right, let's try setting the slicing division on the simpler to a quarter note now and let's see what happens
14:30
[Music]
14:35
with more chops in play. Now we're introducing new textures, too, which instantly makes the loop a lot more
14:41
dynamic and interesting, I think. Here's the loop I came up with after some final
14:47
tweaks and adding extra instrumentation. [Music]
15:07
So next time you find a sample that you like, don't just drop it in your project, but experiment, chop, and tweak
15:12
it to make it truly yours. On to the next technique. For this one, we'll be again using a sample, but this time
Streeeeetch
15:19
we'll take it in an entirely new direction. Now, for the same reason here, I can't play the splice sample,
15:25
but just picture a smooth, peaceful, loungy stack of sounds. Now, let me show you an incredible and free plugin called
15:33
P Stretch. This plugin will take any piece of audio and stretch it into the most beautiful atmospheric pads using
15:40
Paul's extreme time stretch algorithm. According to their website, it can turn any audio into hours or days of ambient
15:48
soundsscapes in an amazingly smooth and beautiful way. Let's see if this holds up. I'll drag in the sample and with the
15:55
stretch amount set to one, you can see in the top right corner that it's about 24 seconds long. But if I crank it all
16:01
the way up, it stretches to a mind-blowing 6 hours and 49 minutes.
16:07
Pure insanity. Let's dial the stretch amount back to around 10, which will extend the sample to just over 4
16:14
minutes. And listen to what it sounds like.
16:28
[Music]
16:33
Anyway, let's render it and import it into Live. All right, we've got the rendered and time stretch sample here.
16:40
So, let's take a listen and see if there are any interesting textures we can work with.
16:53
[Music]
17:13
Yeah, pretty much every part of this sounds epic. My man Paul's algorithm is on another level, man. I've tried
17:20
stretching audio by awkwardly large amounts in Ableton before, but it always ended up sounding pretty rough. But this
17:27
is pure magic. So, thanks, Paul. In the meantime, I've added a simpler to a new
17:32
MIDI channel here into which I'll drag our stretched audio file. Let's unwarp
17:37
and normalize this bad boy and smooth it out even more by adding a very slow attack and very long release to give it
17:43
that evolving pad-like quality.
17:49
[Music]
18:08
I'm playing this on my MIDI keyboard here, by the way. Let's play it an octave down.
18:19
You could easily turn this into a sik simmer type beat.
18:27
[Music]
18:33
And this was just one section of the file. So let's try another one. [Music]
18:59
[Music]
19:06
Let's try two octaves down. [Music]
19:15
I hope you're still awake at this point.
19:25
[Applause]
19:31
All right. Pretty incredible stuff. So, if you're ever in need of big cinematic pads, better call Paul Stretch.
Loop collage
19:40
All right. For this next technique, I've imported a variety of drum loops into Ableton. Each one has its own unique
19:46
character and groove. And if I were to play them all together as they are, it would create a pretty chaotic mix.
20:03
By chopping out the best sections from each drum loop, like the kick drum from one, the snare from another, and so on,
20:09
I can create a unique drum collage that feels like a completely new loop.
20:22
If you're still hearing the tails of a kick or the reverb of a snare in your high hats, you can always tighten the
20:28
transients under the warp section to clean them up. Another great way to make
20:33
certain elements hit better in the groove is by side chaining them to the kick or snare to help them blend more
20:38
naturally into the rhythm. If things are still sounding a little
20:45
detached, you could try blending in a subtle layer like a vinyl crackle or some tape noise to glue everything
20:51
together and make the loop feel a little more cohesive.
20:58
So, next time you're digging through loops, don't just listen to them as a whole, but focus on individual sounds
21:04
that stand out to you. Isolate those elements, blend them with others, and create something entirely new.
Wavetable fun
21:11
All right, for this next tip, I've pulled a couple of loops from the golden pack that I made for Zenheiser a while
21:16
back, which you might have come across on Splice 2. Let's take a quick listen.
21:23
[Music]
21:33
Now, let's have some fun with Wave Table. I'm going to drop in an instance on this MIDI track, which already has a
21:39
MIDI clip loaded from the same sample pack. I'm going to spice it up a bit with some reverb and delay on a return
21:45
channel. And I'll also boost the output gain of wavetable cuz I know from experience it tends to come out a bit
21:51
quiet. Now, what exactly is a wavetable synthesizer? Well, unlike classic synths
21:56
that use a single waveform like a sign, a triangle, or a square wave, a wavetable synth uses wavetables, which
22:03
are basically a collection of waveforms that you can scroll through to shape your sound in more dynamic ways. The
22:10
default wavetable that loads in Liv's wavetable synth is called basic shapes and includes a sign, a triangle, a saw,
22:17
and a square wave. We can easily morph between these waveforms in this wave table using the oscillator position
22:23
slider over here on the right. [Music]
22:35
As we're morphing through these basic shapes, we're actually creating new waveforms that lie in between them.
22:42
The warp and fold parameters at the bottom will really let you twist and bend the wave table in very creative
22:48
ways. [Applause] [Music]
22:57
[Applause]
23:04
[Music]
23:15
So by combining these oscillator position, warp, and full parameters, you can really sculpt the wave table into
23:22
something special and come up with very textural and rich sounds. So now you're
23:27
probably thinking, "Okay, that's cool and all, but what does this have to do with being creative with loops?" Well,
23:33
one of the most fun features of Ableton's wavetable synth is that you can import any sound and use it as a
23:39
wavetable. Just to show you, I'm going to dive into one of my sample packs and scroll through a few melodic hits to
23:45
find one we can use here. [Music]
23:54
You can drag in pretty much any sample and Wavetable will turn it into something usable, but from what I found,
24:00
textured sounds usually give the most interesting results, which is why I went with this particular flute sample.
24:07
[Music]
24:14
Let's try an octave down here, maybe.
24:25
Yeah, this creates a lot more variation for this wave table.
24:39
[Music] Oh, and some pretty sick alien type sounds here, too.
24:51
All right, now let's make the sound a bit more alive. I'll start out by shaping the amp envelope to something a
24:57
little more plucky. And then I'll head over to the mod
25:03
matrix where we can start routing different modulation sources to various parameters. Let's map the amp envelope
25:10
to the warp amount.
25:16
To add even more texture, I'll use LFO one to modulate the wavetable position.
25:22
But we'll need to disable re-trigger on the LFO so it doesn't restart with every new notes.
25:33
[Music] Let's modulate the fold amount with LFO
25:41
2. And let's see what happens when we set
25:47
this LFO to a random waveform.
25:59
If you dial in a negative modulation amount, the parameter will move in the opposite direction.
26:06
[Music]
26:22
Let's try some ma modulation here and see what happens when we use envelope 3 to modulate the rate of LFO one which is
26:30
already modulating the wavet position. [Music]
26:56
If the modulation starts to get a bit out of control, you can always dial back the global modulation amount to keep
27:03
things more in check. [Music]
27:09
This is way faster than having to adjust every individual mod source.
27:16
You can also use the drop down at the top to quickly scroll through other samples that are in the same folder as
27:22
the one we selected, which is super useful for trying out different source material on the fly.
27:33
[Music]
27:39
Let's move on to Wavetable's filter. I'm going to set up a quick filter envelope here using the MS-2 filter and I'll dial
27:46
in a bit of dry for some extra character.
27:52
This filter type really shines when you push the resonance. So, let's crank it and hear how it reacts.
27:59
[Music]
28:08
[Applause]
28:15
[Music] All right, good stuff. Let's drop in an EQ to shape the tone a bit and then add
28:21
a compressor to even out the dynamics across the notes.
28:28
[Music]
28:35
Let's copy over the side chain compressor from one of the other elements and tweak the sound in the
28:40
context of the song.
28:48
[Music]
29:03
I actually like the sound better pitched up an octave. So, let's leave it at that for now. Another cool thing about
29:09
wavetable is that you get a second oscillator, which means we can load in another completely separate wave table.
29:16
I'm going to drop in this bass guitar sample to layer under our pluck just to give it a bit more low-end support.
29:23
[Music] [Applause] [Music] Right now, only the filter modulation is
29:29
hitting the second wave table because both oscillators share the same filter. But we can still modulate stuff from
29:35
oscillator 2 in the mod matrix just like we did with oscillator 1.
29:41
[Music]
29:47
Let's bring oscillator one back in and blend in oscillator 2 until they nicely
29:52
complement each other.
30:15
All right, this has turned into a pretty nice textural and viby pluck. And if you remember, it all started from just a
30:22
trumpet and an electric bass sample. Pretty cool stuff. So far, we've only used melodic sounds for our wave tables,
30:29
but let's switch it up and try something percussive. This Moody Loi pack has a few hip-hop drum loops, too. So, I'm
30:36
going to grab one of those and see what kind of textures we can pull out of it.
30:45
This one sounds pretty tight. So, let's throw it in and see what comes out.
30:53
[Music]
31:02
Since there's a lot of space between the drum hits, a big chunk of the wave table ends up being silence,
31:10
which actually creates this very cool glitchy effect that I absolutely love.
31:16
[Music] Let's just mess around here for a bit and see what comes out.
31:26
[Music]
31:32
A good tip is to set up another audio track to record everything while you're playing around cuz you never know when a
31:38
happy accident may arise and this way you won't miss [Music]
31:56
What I like about these wave tables is that adjusting the position just ever so slightly can completely change the vibe
32:03
of the sound. Let's try another filter type here.
32:09
[Music]
32:18
[Music]
32:34
Subtle movements can go a long way here. [Music]
32:46
On the bottom left here, we can pick several oscillator effects to reshape the wave table even further.
32:57
[Music]
33:06
For this sound, I like the modern setting the best.
33:12
And just a quick reminder here that this super rich and textured sound came from a drum loop. Kind of crazy when you
33:19
think about it. And just like that, you can turn any
33:26
simple sample into a totally new sound with the magic of wavetable synthesis.
33:31
All right, that wraps up the first five tips for getting creative with loops. Stay tuned for part two that will be
33:38
dropping very soon on this channel.
