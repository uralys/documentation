Hello. Today we're going to explore an
0:02
effect that might sound a bit boring,
0:04
but is often highly overlooked as a
0:06
creative tool, the gate. We'll be
0:08
looking at the basic idea and controls
0:10
of the effect first, and then we're
0:12
going to check out a series of creative
0:14
applications. Now, what exactly is a
What is a gate?
0:16
gate? Well, in a way, a gate is the
0:19
opposite of a compressor. While a
0:21
compressor reduces the volume of a
0:23
signal that exceeds a certain threshold,
0:25
represented by the blue line here, a
0:27
gate works the opposite way. it will
0:29
reduce or even completely cut out the
0:32
signal when it falls below that
0:33
threshold level. I personally often use
0:36
them when working with vocals to clean
0:38
up noise in between phrases. Cuz when a
0:40
vocalist records in a less acoustically
0:43
controlled environment with a lot of
0:44
background noise that might be coming
0:46
from the street or an air conditioning
0:48
unit, a gate can automatically silence a
0:51
background noise or even breaths in
0:53
between phrases. iPhone

1:08
recordings, gates are essential to, for
1:10
instance, cut out bleed from symbols or
1:12
snares in a kick drum mic.
1:15
[Music]
1:29
But there's a lot of ways to use a gate
1:31
creatively, too. So, let's look at the
1:33
basic controls first. The threshold is a
1:36
key control here. Setting the volume
1:37
level a signal must exceed to pass
1:40
through the gate.
1:43
The floor level determines to which
1:45
volume the signal is reduced when the
1:47
gate is closed.
1:56
When set to minus infinity, the signal
1:58
is completely cut out when it's below
2:00
the threshold level. There's also a few
2:03
timebased controls that you'll find in
2:05
pretty much any gate effect. The attack
2:08
time controls how quickly the gate opens
2:10
after the signal crosses a threshold.
2:13
[Music]
2:23
After the attack phase, the whole time
2:25
kicks in, determining how long the gate
2:27
stays open, even if the signal drops
2:29
below the threshold level in the
2:30
meantime.
2:34
[Music]
2:37
Once the whole time ends, the release
2:39
time controls how long it takes for the
2:41
gates to return back to floor level.
2:46
[Music]
2:52
On the left, we'll find the three last
2:54
advanced controls. The look ahead will
2:56
introduce a slight delay to the signal,
2:58
allowing the gate to respond more
3:00
accurately to fast transients. There's
3:02
also the flip switch, which lets you
3:04
audition the part of the signal that's
3:06
being gated out. And the return dial
3:08
sets the difference between the
3:09
threshold level that opens the gate and
3:11
the level that closes it, which can
3:13
reduce choppiness in certain cases.
3:16
Cool. Now that we've covered the basics,
3:18
let's see how we can use the gates
3:19
creatively in our music productions.
Bouncy pad
3:22
Okay, so let's kick things off with our
3:24
first technique where we'll be using the
3:26
gates side chain input to add some
3:28
groove and movement to a static pad
3:31
sound. Now, for this example, I made a
3:33
dusty house groove and added a pad sound
3:36
to it, which sounds like this.
3:42
[Music]
3:46
I really like the chords and the tambber
3:48
of this pad, but it feels a bit boring
3:50
and disconnected from the drum groove.
3:52
To give it a bit more texture and
3:54
excitement, I added two parallel
3:56
instances of Sound Toy Crystallizer in
3:58
an audio effect track. The first layer
4:01
creates a grain delay style effect and
4:03
is pitched up an octave. While the
4:05
second layer does the same thing, but is
4:07
pitched up two octaves. To enhance the
4:09
stereo width, I panned one layer to the
4:12
left and the other one to the right.
4:17
Now, let's add some groove using our
4:19
gate effect. I'm going to add the gate
4:21
to our pad sound channel and open up the
4:24
little side chain submen. Now with the
4:26
side chain activated, the gate now
4:28
listens to the track we send into its
4:30
side chain input. Whenever the side
4:32
chain signal now crosses the threshold,
4:34
the gate opens, allowing the pad sound
4:36
to play in rhythm with the track that's
4:38
sent into the side chain input. To give
4:41
the pad some groove, we're going to need
4:42
to send a signal with rhythm and a lot
4:45
of sharp transients into the side chain
4:47
input. Cuz these transients will trigger
4:49
the gate by crossing the threshold. If I
4:52
think about transients and groove, I
4:54
immediately think of a drum break. So,
4:56
let's see which one I found.
5:04
The tone of the drum brake doesn't
5:05
matter for this technique. We're only
5:07
focused on the rhythm of the drum hits
5:09
as they'll dictate the groove of our
5:11
pad. To enhance the transients even
5:13
more, we can play around with the
5:14
preserve settings and decrease the
5:16
sustain of each drum hit.
5:23
[Music]
5:27
You want to make sure to mute the drum
5:28
break as we're only using it to trigger
5:30
the pads gate, not as a part of our
5:32
song. Now, let's head back over to the
5:34
pad channel where we'll select the drum
5:36
brake as the side chain input on our
5:38
gates. And let's mess around with the
5:40
settings to see if we can come up with
5:42
the cool rhythm.
5:43
[Music]
5:48
By moving around the threshold, we can
5:50
control which transients cross it. The
5:52
lower the threshold level, the more even
5:54
the quieter drum hits will exceed the
5:56
threshold level and trigger the pad.
6:02
[Music]
6:05
A longer release time will make it sound
6:07
smoother.
6:10
By increasing the floor level, we're
6:12
sending back in some of the pad's body.
6:17
[Music]
6:32
Let's AB the pad with and without the
6:34
gate.
6:37
[Music]
6:42
and paired with the drums.
6:51
Now, let's make the pad move along to
6:53
the drum groove by side chaining it to
6:55
the kick.
6:57
[Music]
7:19
By automating the release time, we can
7:21
make the groove a little more dynamic
7:23
and evolve over time.
7:27
[Music]
7:31
By holding option or alt and dragging,
7:34
we can turn a linear line into an
7:35
exponential one.
7:37
[Music]
8:18
Let's delete this modulation and see
8:20
what happens when we map an LFO. code to
8:22
the release time.
8:24
[Music]
8:37
Tiny adjustments to the LFO's depth and
8:40
offset parameters can have a big impact
8:42
on the modulation. So, it's important to
8:44
be precise to get the desired effect.
8:49
I personally love setting the LFO rate
8:51
to a non- integer value for a cool poly
8:54
rhythmic groove.
9:00
[Music]
9:06
You can further adjust the groove by
9:08
rearranging the drum brake that's
9:09
triggering the pad, allowing you to
9:11
experiment with different rhythms and
9:13
timings to shape the overall feel.
9:16
[Music]
9:39
The only thing we're still lacking in
9:41
this musical idea is a nice and warm
9:43
baseline. So, I've added in some
9:45
sustained bass notes to go along with
9:47
the chords.
9:57
If you don't have speakers or headphones
9:59
with good bass response, it can be
10:01
helpful to use an EQ to visually check
10:03
if you're hitting the octave with the
10:04
best subcontent for the notes you're
10:06
using. I like using the MIDI pigeon
10:08
device to quickly shift the notes an
10:10
octave up or down without having to go
10:12
into the MIDI clip and doing it
10:13
manually.
10:17
By shifting the notes down an octave, we
10:20
can clearly hear and see that we're
10:21
hitting the right frequency range and
10:23
getting those warm deep subs that we
10:25
want. Next up, I'll add an auto filter
10:28
to isolate only the deepest low end of
10:31
the sound.
10:35
I'll use the MS2 filter type, which is
10:38
inspired by the iconic Corg MS-20
10:40
filter. And I'll increase the drive to
10:42
add some extra fatness and volume.
10:50
To give the bass the same rhythm as the
10:52
pad, I'll copy over both the modulated
10:54
gate and the compressor that side chain
10:56
to the kick.
11:02
[Music]
11:06
Let's see what the bass and the pad
11:08
sound like when combined.
11:16
It's sounding a little muddy in the low
11:18
end, but we can fix this by EQing out
11:20
some of the bass from our pad.
11:28
[Music]
11:34
[Music]
11:35
Cool. The bass now grooves perfectly
11:37
with the pad. So, let's listen to the
11:39
entire loop and hear how it all comes
11:41
together.
11:43
[Music]
11:59
Now, in this case, we're using a drum
12:01
break played by an actual person, which
12:03
gives us a more organic rhythm. However,
Stuttering synth
12:06
if you're aiming for a more sequenced
12:08
robotic groove, you can trigger the
12:10
pad's gate with a programmed pattern. To
12:12
demonstrate this, I made a quick trappy
12:15
idea that sounds like this.
12:18
[Music]
12:29
For the synth chords, I used a very
12:31
basic melt patch, applied some EQing, a
12:33
little chorusing, and side chain them to
12:36
the kick. But let's group these effects
12:38
and get them out of the way. The bass is
12:41
an Ableton preset called 808 Drifter
12:43
that is being ducked by the kick.
12:49
[Music]
12:51
Now, let's make the chords move by
12:53
adding a gate to the channel and routing
12:56
the high hats into its side chain input.
13:21
If you'd rather have the gate triggered
13:22
by a pattern that isn't audible in the
13:24
track, you can duplicate the high hat
13:27
track, mute it, and rename it gate
13:29
trigger. We'll delete all the notes in
13:31
the pattern. If we then head back over
13:33
to the core channel and set the gate
13:35
side chain input to the gate trigger
13:37
track, it will allow us to create a
13:39
pattern that controls the rhythm of the
13:40
pad without being audible in the mix.
13:43
Let's make use of Live's new MIDI
13:45
generative tools and have it generate a
13:47
pattern for us.
13:53
By playing around with the steps,
13:55
density, and pattern dials, we can
13:57
easily tweak the rhythm to find the
13:59
groove that works best for us.
14:13
[Music]
14:26
Let me quickly show you how I use this
14:28
technique to create a choppy baseline in
14:30
my track home. Again, by gating the high
14:33
end of my bass to a simple 16th note
14:35
highhat loop, I created a robotic
14:38
rhythmic groove.
14:41
[Music]
14:59
If you're a fan of these sequenced gate
15:01
rhythms, definitely check out Gate Lab,
15:03
which is a free plugin by Audio Modern
15:05
that comes with a bunch of cool presets
15:07
and stereo options.
Textured drums
15:10
Now, there's a couple of cool things we
15:12
can do by combining gates and reverbs.
15:15
And to demonstrate, I created a dreamy,
15:17
spacious lowfi loop using sounds and
15:20
loops taken from the golden sample pack
15:22
I recently made for Zenheiser, which you
15:24
can find on Splice 2, by the way. So,
15:27
let's have a listen.
15:33
[Music]
15:52
It's still a pretty open and rough idea
15:54
at this point, but there are a few
15:55
things we can do to jazz it up a I've
15:58
layered in a field recording of some
16:00
crackle, which has a sweet amount of
16:02
airy top end to it, which will add nice
16:04
texture and perfectly complement the
16:06
lowfi character of the drums. Now, let's
16:09
use a couple of gate instances to make
16:11
the crackle groove in sync with the drum
16:13
hits. I'll route the kick to its side
16:15
chain input and tweak the controls until
16:17
it blends in nicely with the kick.
16:22
[Music]
16:37
Now, let's do the same thing to the
16:38
snare. Just keep in mind that when using
16:40
multiple gates on a single channel,
16:42
we'll need to set them up in parallel
16:44
using an audio effect track. If we stack
16:46
them in series, one after the other, the
16:49
second gate won't open when the snare
16:50
hits because the first gate is silencing
16:53
everything in between the kicks.
17:06
Now that our snare has some nice crackly
17:09
texture to it, let's duplicate the chain
17:11
one last time and add some texture to
17:13
the high hats. As we're using a very
17:16
small and short high sample here, I'm
17:18
already going to decrease the hold and
17:20
release times.
17:36
[Music]
17:44
Now, let's listen to the entire drum
17:46
groove with and without the gated
17:48
crackle.
18:13
The drums are sounding quite dry at the
18:15
moment, and since we're aiming for a
18:17
dreamy, spacious vibe, adding some
18:19
reverb to the snare might not be a bad
18:21
idea. I've been using the Sound Toy
18:23
Superplay reverb a lot lately. So, I'm
18:25
going to add it to the snare using an
18:27
audio effect track. As usual, we'll
18:29
create a chain for the dry signal and a
18:31
chain for the 100% reverb signal.
18:37
[Music]
18:43
Before we dive into gating, I'll clean
18:45
up the reverb with some subtle EQing.
18:47
There's often some muddiness to be found
18:49
around 200 hertz, so I'll cut a bit
18:51
there. And dipping a few dBs in the 1k
18:54
to 5k range can help smooth things out a
18:56
bit. Especially when working with
18:58
vocals, removing some of the harshness
19:00
in the reverb can make a big difference
19:02
as it creates space for the vocal to cut
19:04
through the mix.
19:09
without EQ
19:12
and with EQ
19:16
a lot smoother. By adding a gate right
19:19
before the reverb and tweaking the
19:21
settings until we're left with just a
19:23
short sharp click, we can dramatically
19:25
alter the character of the decay.
19:28
[Music]
19:34
You really want to push the settings to
19:35
the extreme here to get the shortest
19:37
click possible.
19:43
Let's AB real quick.
19:49
If we now modulate the release, the
19:51
reverb's character will evolve over
19:53
time.
19:55
[Music]
20:04
I'll add an LFO, map it to the release
20:06
time, and play around with the settings.
20:20
[Music]
20:33
By setting the waveform to random, the
20:35
reverb's character will change
20:37
unpredictably with each hit, adding a
20:39
bit of variation and keeping the sound
20:41
dynamic throughout the song.
20:51
These small modulations might seem
20:53
subtle, but they can really add an
20:54
organic human touch to your song. Now,
20:57
instead of going for a plate style
20:59
reverb, let's try a spring reverb. It's
21:01
definitely one of those love it or hate
21:03
it effects, but personally, I'm a big
21:05
fan. So, let's give it a shot and see
21:06
what works here. Normally, I'd reach out
21:09
for one of my outboard spring reverbs,
21:11
but for the sake of this video, we'll
21:13
use Arttoria's spring reverb plugin.
21:15
It's super flexible and really captures
21:17
that classic spring reverb sound almost
21:20
perfectly. I'm going to set the width to
21:22
stereo and the blend to 100% reverb as
21:25
we're using it on a parallel channel.
21:29
[Music]
21:39
The shorter the click, the more rubbery
21:42
and boinky the spring reverb will sound.
22:00
Let's listen to it in context.
22:03
[Music]
22:12
I'm going to bring the reverb down just
22:14
a notch.
22:20
[Music]
22:33
And there we go. We've added a nice high
22:35
crackly texture to the drums and turned
22:37
the reverb into something a little more
22:39
dynamic and interesting just by using a
22:41
gate. Now, by swapping out the position
Classic 80's gated reverb
22:44
of the gate and the reverb and thus
22:46
placing the gate after the reverb, we
22:48
can easily create that classic 80s snare
22:51
sound.
22:55
Here's a very disco inspired drum loop
22:57
that I put together. I added the lexicon
23:00
reverb to the clap that hits on every
23:02
second snare and narrow down the reverb
23:04
using the utility tools with control. If
23:06
I turn on the gate after the reverb, it
23:08
will suddenly cut off, creating an
23:10
almost claustrophobic effect.
23:19
The hold and release parameters will let
23:21
you shape the reverb's tail.
Bursts of reverb
23:45
Now, lastly, I want to quickly show you
23:47
one more reverb related gating trick
23:49
that I use to enhance a chopped up synth
23:51
loop in my track Dusty Echoes. Let me
23:53
quickly show you.
23:57
[Music]
23:58
The sound you're hearing is a loop I
24:00
recorded on an Eminem 310 organ and then
24:02
ran through a chase bliss the delay
24:05
pedal.
24:11
I added a parallel reverb to the syn
24:13
loop and placed the gate before it so
24:15
that only the loudest syn hits will
24:17
trigger the reverb.
24:20
[Music]
24:28
This creates a rhythmic reverb effect
24:30
instead of a long tail that washes out
24:32
the entire loop.
24:35
[Music]
24:47
All right, enough about reverb. Let's
24:49
switch gears and explore how we can use
24:51
a gate to creatively layer electronic
24:53
drums with an old drum break to add a
24:55
gritty vintage character to our groove.
Glitchy drum fills
24:58
For this example, I cooked up a pretty
25:00
lights Michael Menard's electro soul
25:02
kind of vibe consisting of a halftime
25:04
drum loop layered with a guitar, an
25:06
asset type sequence that I made using my
25:08
modular synth, and a fluttery synth loop
25:11
coming from my Moog Matriarch.
25:13
[Music]
25:24
We've got guitar chords with some echo.
25:29
[Music]
25:32
a raw synth sequence
25:38
and some weird synth plucks.
25:46
[Music]
25:54
I then brought in a drum rig that I
25:56
pitched down to match the tempo of the
25:58
project, applied the gate, and routed
26:00
the kick to its side chain input.
26:04
[Applause]
26:15
I duplicated the track and did the same
26:17
thing for the snare.
26:19
[Applause]
26:21
[Music]
26:21
[Applause]
26:26
I could have combined the kick and snare
26:28
gates into a single channel using an
26:30
audio effect track just like we did
26:32
earlier in this video, but I chose to
26:34
separate them here. In a third channel,
26:37
I added the same drum brake but at
26:39
double tempo, which sounds like this.
26:51
By isolating the shuffling parts of the
26:53
break that happened in between our kick
26:55
and snare and then applying a gate to
26:57
focus in on the transients, we can
27:00
create a cool glitchy percussive loop.
27:04
Do note that we're not using the side
27:06
chain input here.
27:09
[Music]
27:10
[Applause]
27:12
[Music]
27:18
If we now bring the programmed drums
27:20
back in, you'll notice how the gated
27:21
break adds a raw organic touch and a
27:23
nice shuffly rhythm to the mix.

You could also manually chop out the
27:41
parts of the brake that align with the
27:42
kick and the snare, but using a gate
27:44
makes it way more flexible as a gated
27:47
brake layer will automatically adjust to
27:49
any changes you make in a MIDI pattern
27:51
of your kick and your snare.

All right, that wraps up this video on
28:03
the creative use of gates. If you have
28:06
any questions or other gate related
28:08
tricks yourself, feel free to share them
28:10
in the comments. I'll see you all in the
28:11
next video soon. Cheers.
