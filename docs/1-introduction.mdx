# Introduction

I've found many great channels and artists on youtube along my journey to learn music production, sound design, mixing and mastering.

First I extract the key points of their videos in markdown files thanks to [Insightkeeper AI Summarizer](https://www.insightkeeper.ai/), then I create demo projects with Ableton Live 12 to experiment these techniques by myself.

Finally I store all in this docusaurus to create somehow a [Second Brain](https://www.insightkeeper.ai/blog/what-is-a-second-brain-unlocking-the-power-of-digital-knowledge-management) from all these learnings, so I find and can use them later on my music productions.

Enjoy whatever you can find here, and listen to my tracks [on your favorite platform](  https://linktr.ee/uralys)
